    "Scenario_title": "Why roses are red",
    "Scenario": "Roses are red due to the presence of a pigment called anthocyanin. This pigment is responsible for giving the petals their red color. The production of this pigment is influenced by the pH level of the soil in which the rose plant grows. If the soil is acidic, the rose petals will be redder, while more alkaline conditions result in pink or white petals. In addition to anthocyanin, other pigments also contribute to the variety of colors seen in roses, including carotenoids {{yellowAndOrange}} and flavonols {{whiteAndCream}}. Overall, roses' red color is a result of a complex biochemical process stimulated by environmental factors.",
